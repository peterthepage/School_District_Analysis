# School_District_Analysis
# Purpose - 
The purpose of this analysis was to discern what factors lead to school success. By looking at the
size, type, and spending per student we were able to get a feel for what is the best school for success.

# Results -
Removing the Thomas 9th graders led to across the board losses in passing scores. While the differences in averages
were negligible the passing rates at Thomas decreased by at least 25% in reading, math, and overall passing rates.

# Summary -
